After I finish the things mentioned in the UI I will do the UI for the cursor generator which is currently existing in the code. Then I will make the UIs look even nicer (wow how could that be possible) and add boxes for typing values, then I will port effects between the hitcircle and cursor shader so we can have gumdrop/blazing sun hitcircles and mechanical cursors. then I forgot the other thing I was going to do.
